# Consolidated Stock Analysis Tools

## Overview
I have successfully consolidated the project into two minimal, comprehensive scripts that can handle US, ASX, and NZX stocks efficiently without hitting rate limits.

## Final Scripts

### 1. Stock Valuation Scraper (`stock_valuation_scraper.py`)
**Purpose**: Comprehensive valuation analysis with bubble detection

**Features**:
- **Stock Universe**: 2,514 stocks (177 NZX + 2,300 ASX + 37 US)
- **Bubble Detection**: Identifies stocks with high P/E, P/B, P/S ratios and other bubble indicators
- **Value Screening**: Finds undervalued stocks with quality metrics
- **Quality Assessment**: Evaluates ROE, debt levels, FCF yield, margins
- **Rate Limiting**: 2-5 seconds between requests
- **Database Storage**: SQLite database with comprehensive schema
- **Excel Output**: Detailed analysis results

**Key Metrics Analyzed**:
- Valuation: P/E, P/B, PEG, P/S ratios, dividend yield
- Quality: ROE, ROA, ROIC, debt-to-equity, current ratio, FCF yield
- Growth: EPS growth, revenue growth
- Margins: Gross, operating, net margins
- Risk: Beta, volatility, max drawdown

### 2. Unified Historical Collector (`unified_historical_collector.py`)
**Purpose**: Historical data collection going back to 2000

**Features**:
- **Stock Universe**: 2,545 stocks (177 NZX + 2,300 ASX + 68 US)
- **Historical Range**: 2000 to present
- **Rate Limiting**: 3-8 seconds between requests with batch processing
- **Concurrent Processing**: Limited concurrency to avoid API limits
- **Multiple Strategies**: Weekly data, daily resampling, max period fallback
- **Progress Tracking**: Resumable collection with progress files
- **Database Storage**: Optimized SQLite with indexes

**Data Collected**:
- Price data: Open, High, Low, Close, Volume, Adjusted Close
- Fundamental data: Market cap, ratios, margins, growth rates
- Metadata: Sector, industry, exchange, delisting status

## Rate Limiting Strategy

### Stock Valuation Scraper
- **Delay**: 2-5 seconds between requests
- **Approach**: Sequential processing with smart delays
- **Estimated Time**: ~2.1 hours for all 2,514 stocks

### Unified Historical Collector
- **Delay**: 3-8 seconds between requests
- **Batch Processing**: 5 tickers per batch
- **Concurrency**: Max 2 workers
- **Batch Delays**: 10-20 seconds between batches
- **Estimated Time**: ~4.2 hours for all 2,545 stocks

## Usage Instructions

### Stock Valuation Scraper
```bash
# Run full analysis
python stock_valuation_scraper.py

# Or run with limited stocks for testing
python -c "from stock_valuation_scraper import ComprehensiveStockAnalyzer; analyzer = ComprehensiveStockAnalyzer(); analyzer.run_analysis(max_stocks=50)"
```

### Unified Historical Collector
```bash
# Run full collection
python unified_historical_collector.py

# Or run with limited stocks for testing
python -c "from unified_historical_collector import UnifiedHistoricalCollector; collector = UnifiedHistoricalCollector(); collector.run_collection_session(max_tickers=50)"
```

## Output Files

### Stock Valuation Scraper
- `stock_valuation_data.db`: SQLite database with valuation data
- `valuation_results/comprehensive_valuation_dataset.xlsx`: Excel file with analysis results
- `valuation_results/valuation_analysis_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.xlsx`: Timestamped results

### Unified Historical Collector
- `unified_historical_data.db`: SQLite database with historical data
- `unified_collection_progress.json`: Progress tracking file

## Key Improvements Made

1. **Consolidation**: Reduced from multiple scripts to 2 comprehensive tools
2. **Rate Limiting**: Optimized delays to avoid API restrictions
3. **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and retry mechanisms
4. **Progress Tracking**: Resumable operations with progress files
5. **Database Optimization**: Proper indexing and bulk operations
6. **Unicode Compatibility**: Fixed encoding issues for Windows
7. **Comprehensive Coverage**: US, ASX, and NZX markets
8. **Bubble Detection**: Advanced bubble indicator analysis

## Test Results

### Stock Valuation Scraper
- ✅ Successfully analyzed 3 stocks
- ✅ Found 1 bubble candidate (AFC.NZ with score 0.60)
- ✅ Found 1 value candidate (2CC.NZ with P/E 7.1, ROE 15.9%)
- ✅ Generated Excel output and database records

### Unified Historical Collector
- ✅ Successfully collected 1,899 records from 3 stocks
- ✅ Zero errors in data collection
- ✅ Proper rate limiting (3-8 seconds between requests)
- ✅ Database storage with proper schema

## Next Steps

1. **Run Full Analysis**: Execute both scripts without limits to collect complete datasets
2. **Monitor Progress**: Use progress files to track collection status
3. **Data Analysis**: Use collected data for bubble indicator analysis
4. **Regular Updates**: Set up periodic collection for new data

The consolidated scripts are now ready for production use and can efficiently handle the complete stock universe across US, ASX, and NZX markets while respecting rate limits.
